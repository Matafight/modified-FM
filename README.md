# modified-FM

 The code of the modified-FM (Factorization Machine), we use different regularizer for the Factorization Machine,and also implement the higher order FM（>=3）.
 - [higher order FM](https://github.com/Matafight/modified-FM/tree/dev/higher-order-fm)
    Implement higher order factorization machine using sgd
 - [adaptive-FM](https://github.com/Matafight/modified-FM/tree/dev/ord-fm-adaptive-sgd)
    Implement second order factorization machine with adaptive regularizer
 - [sgl-fm-sgd](https://github.com/Matafight/modified-FM/tree/dev/sgl-fm-sgd)
    There are four kinds of FM in this sub directory,including sparse group lasso based FM , L21 based FM ,L1 based FM and the square of L2 norm based FM.
 - [sgl-higher-order-fm-sgd](https://github.com/Matafight/modified-FM/tree/dev/sgl-higher-order-fm-sgd)
    Implement the higher order factorization machine with sparse group lasso regularization(not tested yet)
